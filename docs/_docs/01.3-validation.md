We validate our CathSim simulator and robots through testing on both phantom models and animal subjects.

## Phantom Setup

</div>

To simulate human vascular anatomy, we use a half-body vascular phantom model, which is connected to a closed water circuit to mimic blood flow. We utilize a Bi-planar X-ray system equipped with 60 kW Epsilon X-ray Generators and 16-inch Image Intensifier Tubes for high-definition imaging.

The surgeon operates the master device from a control room to drive the follower robot located in the X-ray room.

## Animal Setup

</div>
We use pigs as animal subjects for our validation, as their anatomy shares similarities with that of humans.


## Catheterization Target

</div>
The catheterization targets are the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) and the left common carotid artery (LCCA).


## SplineFormer Network

</div>

We propose SplineFormer, a new transformer-based architecture, designed specifically to predict the continuous, smooth shape of the guidewire in an explainable way.


## Expert Navigation Network

</div>
Our Expert Navigation Network is a multimodal system trained using CathSim simulator and subsequently transferred to the real robot.


## Segmentation Model
<div class="image-container">

</div>
We introduce a shape-sensitive loss function for catheter and guidewire segmentation and utilize it in a vision transformer network to establish a new state-of-the-art result on a large-scale X-ray images dataset.


## Results

The results demonstrate the successful integration of simulation, machine learning, and vision technologies to achieve autonomous catheterization.
